# Missing GitHub Secrets

You need to add these additional secrets to your GitHub repository:

Go to: https://github.com/something111-del/GoCamp/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" and add:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | `karepalli123@gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PASS` | `ehjicrjiycpjcdhw` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | `karepalli123@gmail.com` |

These are needed for the admin invite email functionality to work.
